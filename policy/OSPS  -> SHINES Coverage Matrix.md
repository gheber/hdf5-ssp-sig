# OSPS → SHINES Coverage Matrix

See [Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org/versions/devel).

## Legend

* **COVERED** = a SHINES control’s evidence pointer clearly aligns with the OSPS requirement
* **PARTIAL** = related SHINES evidence exists, but the OSPS requirement isn’t explicit in the evidence pointers
* **GAP** = no clear SHINES evidence pointer for that OSPS requirement

**Counts:** COVERED **22**, PARTIAL **25**, GAP **15**.

## Gaps at a glance (OSPS controls flagged GAP in the matrix)

These are the places where the evidence-pointer table doesn’t show an obvious SHINES control match (i.e., would be the most immediate candidates for SHINES-policy additions or for adding explicit evidence pointers):

* **CI/CD permissions least privilege**
  * OSPS-AC-04.01 (L2)
  * OSPS-AC-04.02 (L3)
* **CI/CD input sanitization**
  * OSPS-BR-01.01 (L1)
  * OSPS-BR-01.02 (L1)
* **User-facing documentation basics**
  * OSPS-DO-01.01 (L1) — user guides for basic functionality
  * OSPS-DO-02.01 (L1) — defect reporting guide
* **Project governance documentation**
  * OSPS-GV-01.02 (L2) — roles & responsibilities
* **Contributor legal attestation**
  * OSPS-LE-01.01 (L2) — per-commit legal authorization assertion (e.g., DCO/CLA patterns)
* **Repository hygiene / transparency items not evidenced**
  * OSPS-QA-01.01 (L1) — public repo at static URL
  * OSPS-QA-01.02 (L1) — public change record
  * OSPS-QA-04.01 (L1) — list of subprojects
  * OSPS-QA-05.01 (L1) — no generated executables in VCS
  * OSPS-QA-05.02 (L1) — no unreviewable binaries in VCS
